"""JSON schemas for the hermes-bug-vision-ticket plugin.

Two schemas live here:

* ``TOOL_SCHEMA`` — the OpenAI-function-style schema the model sees for the
  ``report_bug_from_screenshot`` tool. Per the Hermes contract the tool's
  ``description`` lives *inside* this dict (``tools/registry.py`` reads
  ``schema.get("description", "")``), so it doubles as the registration
  description.
* ``BUG_REPORT_SCHEMA`` — the normalized vision-extraction schema passed to
  ``ctx.llm.complete_structured(json_schema=...)`` and re-validated locally
  before the extracted report is trusted (added in the vision phase).

Both are plain data — no imports, no side effects — so importing this module
during ``register(ctx)`` is cheap and safe.
